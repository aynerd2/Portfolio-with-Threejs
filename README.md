## Introduction
The most impressive websites in the world use 3D graphics and animations to bring their content to life so i Learnt how to build my own ThreeJS 3D Developer Portfolio! from Jsmastery

 I made use of the following:
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework

i also learnt how to:
- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Make your code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
- Implement sending emails through a form on the website
